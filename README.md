<h1 align="center">Email Spam Detection</h1>

## About the Project

I developed an email spam detection system using logistic regression, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled emails, allowing it to effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The project is version-controlled using GitHub, facilitating collaboration and continuous integration. For deployment, I containerized the application using Docker, ensuring consistent performance across different environments. This streamlined approach not only enhances the model's reliability but also makes it scalable and easy to maintain.

## Usage

The app provides a simple interface for users to input an email and receive a prediction on whether it is spam or not. The model is highly accurate and can be used to filter out unwanted emails effectively.

## Roadmap

The project is currently in the final stages of development. Future updates will focus on improving the model's performance and adding more features to the app. I plan to integrate additional machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the spam detection system further. I also aim to deploy the app on a cloud platform to make it accessible to a wider audience.
